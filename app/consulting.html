                        <p class="excerpt">No matter what size vehicle fleet you have, whether it's fifty, five hundred, or five thousand vehicles,
                            someone has to manage the fleet. That person may be an administrative assistant in charge of
                            the fleet on a part time basis, or a full-time professional fleet manager with a staff of several
                            people.
                            <br>
                            <br>Whatever the title or amount of time devoted to fleet management, specific questions must be
                            addressed for a fleet to be an effective part of your organization. How will you handle vehicle
                            acquisition and disposal? Selection and suitability? Title and licensing? Records storage? Risk
                            management? Maintenance? Fueling? The list of questions can be quite long.This is where a fleet
                            consultant can help. A fleet consultant's knowledge and experience is of great value to small
                            to mid-sized organizations where no one has the time or expertise to properly manage the fleet.
                            A fleet consultant can be instrumental in creating a management strategy that addresses the particular
                            needs of your vehicle fleet in an efficient and effective manner. And even if your fleet has
                            a seasoned professional in charge, the fresh perspective of an outside fleet consultant can be
                            very beneficial to your organization. Or there may be a situation where a special project, or
                            new strategic initiative, could require some extra help.
